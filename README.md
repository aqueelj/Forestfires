# Forestfires
Analyzing the cause of forest fires to develop a model to help early detection and avoid spread of fires.

This project explores the data collected at the montesinho national park in Portugal for analyzing forest fires. The dataset contains the Fire Weather Index (FWI) features which is a system used to quantify the risk of forest fires. Various multivariate analysis techniques have been applied which have been explained in detail in the Project Report.

Uno.rmd is the main r-code which contains the code along with the results in an R-markdown file.
Project Report includes documentation regarding the techniques used in the analysis and the motivation behind it.
The csv file contains the Forest Fires dataset used in the analysis.

Note: The aim of this project is to apply certain multivariate analysis and unsupervised learning techiques on the target dataset and hence 
achieving a high level of accuracy in supervised learning is not a priority. However, this is being worked on and will be released in the future versions of this project.
